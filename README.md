# coinFlipper
Flips coins however many times you want and tells you what percentage was heads/tails.

Currently have it setup to run forever without any messing with the code - that's because this is
not the final version. I'm still playing around with it. However, if you want to switch it to a PyPi 
uploadable version, all you should need to do is change the prints to returns and add an if main from line 27.
